gb is a stress test tool based on Apache Benchmark.


To run it just:

gb -t http://localhost:8089 -c 2 -n 100

It will start two Workers to request 100 times each.

Available parameters by now are:
-t target. It may change, bu represents the target http server.
-c concurrent. Number of clients to perform the requests.
-n requests. Number of request each client should perform.

Licencing?
